# Atlas

Simple app to facilitate large scale map organization for Minecraft.
I wanted to create a large grid of maps (in item frames) and wanted to keep track of each maps location (for sanity).
Writing it by hand proved too onerous, so I made this to increase speed of documenting.

## How
My goal was speed, so the feature set is limited to my specific needs.
Simple Express server to serve up a Vuejs app, and API to store the flatfile for map locations
